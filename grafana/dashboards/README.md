# vLLM Dashboard

Place your vLLM Grafana dashboard JSON file here.

The guide mentioned downloading a file called `vllm_grafana_dashboard.json` from your colleague.
Save that file as `vllm_grafana_dashboard.json` in this directory.

The dashboard will automatically be loaded into Grafana when the containers start up.
